# ~~CRUD Starter Frontend~~ CRUD React

Trying to challenge myself and refactor this project.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krymancer/crud-react/main/.assets/main.png)

~~It uses Bootstrap styles and reactstrap, which creates Bootstrap components, to create a responsive data table that displays all data from a table in a database. It has a modal form for adding and editing items, a delete and edit button in each item row.~~

Uses only tailwindcss and vanilla react components, much smaller bundle size.

Now also use React v18, which is a new version of React that is faster and smaller.
Also using Vite, which is better, smaller and faster than webpack.

## Instructions

### Clone

    git clone https://github.com/Krymancer/crud-react.git

### Install Dependencies

    pnpm install

you can also use yarn or npm
